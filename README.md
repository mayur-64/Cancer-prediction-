Releasing my first GITHUB repository. Project is based on Credit card fraud detection using basic Machine learning algorithms. 

**Problem Statement:**
Financial threats are displaying a trend about the credit risk of commercial banks as the
incredible improvement in the financial industry has arisen. In this way, one of the
biggest threats faces by commercial banks is the risk prediction of credit clients. The
goal is to predict the probability of credit default based on credit card owner's
characteristics and payment history.

**Approach:** The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,
Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine
learning algorithms that’s best fit for the above case.

We have started with data exploration, Data cleaning(if required), model building and modeltesting. We have implemented 3 different Machine learning algorithms, which are as follows :


      

**Results:** You have to build a solution that should able to predict the probability of credit
default based on credit card owner’s characteristics and payment history.
