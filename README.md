**Releasing my first GITHUB repository. Project is based on Credit card fraud detection using basic Machine learning algorithms. **

**Problem Statement:**
Financial threats are displaying a trend about the credit risk of commercial banks as the
incredible improvement in the financial industry has arisen. In this way, one of the
biggest threats faces by commercial banks is the risk prediction of credit clients. The
goal is to predict the probability of credit default based on credit card owner's
characteristics and payment history.

**Approach:** The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,
Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine
learning algorithms that’s best fit for the above case.

We have started with data exploration, Data cleaning(if required), model building and modeltesting. We have implemented 3 different Machine learning algorithms, which are as follows :


      

**Results:** You have to build a solution that should able to predict the probability of credit
default based on credit card owner’s characteristics and payment history.


**Dataset Information**
This dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005.

**Content**
There are 25 variables:

ID: ID of each client
LIMIT_BAL: Amount of given credit in NT dollars (includes individual and family/supplementary credit
SEX: Gender (1=male, 2=female)
EDUCATION: (1=graduate school, 2=university, 3=high school, 4=others, 5=unknown, 6=unknown)
MARRIAGE: Marital status (1=married, 2=single, 3=others)
AGE: Age in years
PAY_0: Repayment status in September, 2005 (-1=pay duly, 1=payment delay for one month, 2=payment delay for two months, … 8=payment delay for eight months, 9=payment delay for nine months and above)
PAY_2: Repayment status in August, 2005 (scale same as above)
PAY_3: Repayment status in July, 2005 (scale same as above)
PAY_4: Repayment status in June, 2005 (scale same as above)
PAY_5: Repayment status in May, 2005 (scale same as above)
PAY_6: Repayment status in April, 2005 (scale same as above)
BILL_AMT1: Amount of bill statement in September, 2005 (NT dollar)
BILL_AMT2: Amount of bill statement in August, 2005 (NT dollar)
BILL_AMT3: Amount of bill statement in July, 2005 (NT dollar)
BILL_AMT4: Amount of bill statement in June, 2005 (NT dollar)
BILL_AMT5: Amount of bill statement in May, 2005 (NT dollar)
BILL_AMT6: Amount of bill statement in April, 2005 (NT dollar)
PAY_AMT1: Amount of previous payment in September, 2005 (NT dollar)
PAY_AMT2: Amount of previous payment in August, 2005 (NT dollar)
PAY_AMT3: Amount of previous payment in July, 2005 (NT dollar)
PAY_AMT4: Amount of previous payment in June, 2005 (NT dollar)
PAY_AMT5: Amount of previous payment in May, 2005 (NT dollar)
PAY_AMT6: Amount of previous payment in April, 2005 (NT dollar)
default.payment.next.month: Default payment (1=yes, 0=no)
